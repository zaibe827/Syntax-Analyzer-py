## Lexical and Semantic Analyzer

This project provides a Python-based tool for lexical and semantic analysis of source code. It comprises three main components:

1. **Lexical Analyzer**: Utilizes regular expressions to tokenize input code, identifying keywords, identifiers, literals, operators and special characters. It also handles string literals and whitespace.


3. **Symbol Table**: Maintains a symbol table to store information about variables, constants and their corresponding memory locations. This table enhances the analysis process and aids in error detection.

The project provides a foundation for building more advanced compilers, interpreters, or code analysis tools.
